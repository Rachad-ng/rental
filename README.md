# rental
Simple SAAS SpringBoot application , it's the first version that requires several patches,
either at the level of code optimization or at the level of compliance with good practices.  
Iâ€™ll be creating another project with the same functionalities but using a REST architecture in the backend and in the front end i'll be using either Angular or React.  
I'll also try to make the code more abstract to make it possible to use it in other contexts besides Car rental system.
